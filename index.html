            <ol>

                <li>Clear your mind of everything outside of this moment.</li>
                <li>Start with your outer wrists resting on your knees.</li>
                <li>Using your right hand, fold your middle and index fingers toward your palm.</li>

        <img id="sk" src="img4.png" alt="Not Found">
            <p>This pranayama derives its name from the Bhramari, the black Indian bee. The exhalation resembles the typical humming sound of a bee!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Sit on the Padmasana or any other sitting Asana.·</li>
                <li>Close your eyes and breathe deeply.·</li>

        <img id="sk" src="img5.png" alt="Not Found">
            <p>Also known as victorious breath or ocean breath, this breathing technique involves a soft hissing sound during inhalation.</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Retain the inhaled air for a period of 6 seconds (preferably double the period of inspiration).</li>

                <li>Now exhale as naturally as possible – gradually, avoiding jerky or hasty movements.</li>
                <li>Take few normal breaths and relax.
